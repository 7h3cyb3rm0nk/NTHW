#### Writing Your First Java Program

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**  
   - **Download and Install the Java Development Kit (JDK):** You can download the latest version of the JDK from Oracle's official website - [link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - **Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Popular IDEs for Java include IntelliJ IDEA - [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), Eclipse - [link](https://www.eclipse.org/), and NetBeans - [link](https://netbeans.apache.org/). You can also use a simple text editor like VS Code - [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Java extensions.

2. **Write Your First Java Program**  
   Open your IDE or text editor and create a new file named `HelloWorld.java`. Enter the following code:

   ```java
   public class HelloWorld {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Compile and Run Your Program**  
   - **Using the Command Line:** Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where you saved `HelloWorld.java`. Compile the program with the following command:
     ```bash
     javac HelloWorld.java
     ```
     This command will generate a `HelloWorld.class` file.

   - **Run the Program:** Execute the compiled bytecode with the following command:
     ```bash
     java HelloWorld
     ```

   You should see the output:
   ```bash
   Hello, World!
   ```

4. **Using an IDE:**  
   - In your IDE, create a new project and add a new Java file with the code above.
   - Most IDEs have a built-in compiler and run feature. You can usually find a "Run" button or use a shortcut (like `Shift + F10` in IntelliJ IDEA) to compile and run your program.
