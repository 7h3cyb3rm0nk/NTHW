Incidents (happenings, events, accidents, attacks, crises …) involving information typically cause or involve a loss of or reduction in its:
• Confidentiality – unauthorised/inappropriate disclosure or revelation or exposure of sensitive information;
• Integrity – incomplete, inaccurate or out-of-date information; and/or
• Availability – information cannot be accessed and used for its intended purposes, for a while or indefinitely.
Those are the primary effects. However, incidents can also have secondary adverse effects such as a loss of or reduction in:
• Compliance with legal, regulatory or contractual obligations – increasing the possibility of penalties such as fines and additional supervision;
• Conformity with and satisfaction of personal, corporate or societal requirements, including ethical expectations;
• Access to information e.g. it may take longer or be more difficult to acquire sufficient, appropriate data for various purposes;
• Information management capabilities e.g. the legitimate owners of information may be unable to secure it, restrict/permit access to it, determine who can
use and how and when etc., or may feel it is not even worth attempting to do so due to losing confidence in security;
• Quality e.g. AI systems may hallucinate, offering factually inaccurate but plausible information, or advisors may give misleading, inappropriate, inaccurate or
incomplete advice4;
• Flexibility e.g. it is costlier, harder, more complicated and takes longer to plan, execute and test/validate/accredit changes to a secure IT system or process;
• Reliability and trustworthiness e.g. it may be unclear or uncertain whether information is sufficiently correct, complete, current and controlled following an
incident, particularly if the exact nature and sequence of events cannot be ascertained;
• Understanding of information e.g. due to translation or transcription errors, inadequately-explained or ineptly-expressed concepts, cultural and
comprehension issues;
• Utility e.g. information that is no longer considered sufficiently trustworthy, complete, accurate and up-to-date for its intended purposes may be unusable
Furthermore, incidents may lead to an increase in:
• Information processing, communication and storage – aside from overheads caused by the operation of security controls, security logs typically store
pertinent information for later analysis, and some incidents involve the deliberate or accidental accumulation of ‘junk’ data obscuring events;
• Delays – slowing down dependent decisions, activities or processes while necessary information is obtained and verified;
• Complexity – increasing controls for a system or process makes it more complicated, adding ‘moving parts’ that all need to function properly and interoperate
smoothly; and
• Uncertainties and risks of further incidents – once an incident such as a ransomware attack or privacy breach occurs, that may increase the probability and/or
impacts of further incidents.
Ultimately, incidents destroy value. As a consequence of various incidents, information is worth less to its legitimate owners and users, and perhaps more to
adversaries or competitors. Furthermore, incidents drive up losses and costs such as:
• The direct loss of asset value e.g. theft and misuse of intellectual property or trade secrets, or reputational damage and brand devaluation;
• Consequential costs due to disruption or prevention of downstream business activities e.g. urgent revision or suspension of commercial plans to launch new
products;
• Costs associated with managing, investigating and resolving incidents e.g. attempting to resume control and regain customer trust, loyalty and custom;
• The full lifecycle costs of various controls – from specification and design through to their operation, management and maintenance;
• Opportunity costs – other potentially beneficial investments or activities are delayed, curtailed or prevented due to the lack of funds and other finite resources,
including management and staff attention and energy; and
• External impacts e.g. privacy breaches adversely affect the lives of the individuals whose personal information is compromised.
In the business context, it makes no sense to spend a fortune on reducing trivial incidents. Conversely, targeted investment to avoid, prevent or contain the
damaging effects of significant risks is entirely justified, even necessary. Therefore, we really need to analyse and quantify risk in order to invest appropriately,
especially given limited/finite resources.
Incidents fall on a notional impact or damage scale from zero (having absolutely no adverse effect on the organisation at whatsoever) to catastrophic, maybe even
existential. Incidents also vary in likelihood from never or extremely rare to commonplace or continuous. Risk is a combination of both impact and likelihood.

Decide on risk treatments
There are four generally-accepted ways of treating risks:
1. Risk avoidance - stopping or not starting particularly risky activities at all. This is seldom appropriate because we normally only do things that have some
purpose and value, so if we don’t do them to avoid the associated risk, we lose that value. However, we do sometimes have the option of not taking on
significant risks e.g. by consciously and deliberately not releasing sensitive, valuable information to untrustworthy third parties, or pulling out of business
arrangements that have become unduly threatening to our interests. 

2. Risk reduction through security controls - most risks are ‘mitigated’ in some fashion using technological, procedural or physical controls (also known as
measures, countermeasures, safeguards etc.). Most controls have a specific purpose (e.g. antivirus controls attempt to spot and block malware infections)
while some others are general-purpose (e.g. resilience and backups). Multi-purpose controls (e.g. policies and procedures) can address several risks at
once, and as such are often more valuable but less effective than single-purpose controls.

3. Sharing risks with third parties - some risks can be shared by insurers, customers, owners, communities etc., who undertake to deal with them or accept
the consequences (defined liabilities). Website privacy policies are an example: visitors who provide their contact details or other personal information
through the website share some of the risk of privacy breaches with the SME on the understanding that specific privacy controls (as laid out in the policies)
are in place. Insurance is another example: the insurer undertakes to compensate the insured if specific situations occur, provided the insured has taken
‘reasonable’ (and often specified) steps to reduce the risk. Risks can be shared internally too. SMEs may opt to hold the IT department accountable for all
IT risks rather than the individual departments - on the proviso that whoever is accountable has the ability to make key decisions about the risks, and has
control over sufficient resources to.

4. Risk acceptance - all the remaining risks are said to be accepted, whether deliberately and expressly, or not. We accept risks that were only partially
treated by other means (e.g. where the controls are not entirely effective and reliable, or where situations we intended to avoid occur anyway, or where
our attempted quantification was inaccurate, perhaps because things changed unexpectedly) plus risks that were untreated (e.g. risks we didn’t even
identify as such, due to flaws in that part of the risk analysis process).
