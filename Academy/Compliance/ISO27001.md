# Not The Hidden Wiki

ISO27001 is about Risk in Information System.

## ISO - International Organisation for Standardization

ISO is an independent, non-governmental, global organisation that develops and publishes international standards covering various aspects of technology, engineering, industry and business. These standards ensure consistency, safety, interoperability, and quality in products, services, and management systems across the globe - thousands of ISO standards touching everyday aspects of modern life.

ISO publishes numerous standards concerning information security, business continuity, risk management, and related areas, some developed in conjunction with the International Electrotechnical Commission, Cloud Security Alliance, ISACA, and others:

- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** - Defines requirements for scoping, planning, implementing, maintaining, and continuously improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). The standard offers a set of 93 generic information security controls to be used as a checklist, ensuring that nothing important gets forgotten. Although it is intended to apply to all organisations, in practice, ISO/IEC 27001 is often seen as overkill for SMEs. However, the fundamental principles (such as the systematic risk-based approach) are sound and proven, underpinning adaptive SME security.
  
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 - Information Security Management Systems - A Practical Guide for SMEs** is a new (2024) handbook from ISO, supporting SMEs in developing and implementing ISO/IEC 27001 information security management systems.

- **ISO 22301:2019** - Similarly defines requirements for planning, implementing, maintaining, and continuously improving a Business Continuity Management System (BCMS). The purpose of a BCMS is to identify risks, prepare for emergencies, continue essential business activities if possible, and if not, recover as soon as possible from disruptive events to the organisation.

- **ISO 31000:2018** - A framework of generic processes for managing all kinds of risks affecting your organisation systematically.

## Impact of Incidents on Information

**Incidents** (happenings, events, accidents, attacks, crises, etc.) involving information typically cause or involve a loss of or reduction in its:

- **Confidentiality** – Unauthorised/inappropriate disclosure or revelation or exposure of sensitive information;
- **Integrity** – Incomplete, inaccurate, or out-of-date information; and/or
- **Availability** – Information cannot be accessed and used for its intended purposes, for a while or indefinitely.

Those are the primary effects. However, incidents can also have secondary adverse effects such as a loss of or reduction in:

- Compliance with legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations – increasing the possibility of penalties such as fines and additional supervision;
- Conformity with and satisfaction of personal, corporate, or societal requirements, including ethical expectations;
- Access to information e.g. it may take longer or be more difficult to acquire sufficient, appropriate data for various purposes;
- Information management capabilities e.g. the legitimate owners of information may be unable to secure it, restrict/permit access to it, determine who can use and how and when etc., or may feel it is not even worth attempting to do so due to losing confidence in security;
- Quality e.g. AI systems may hallucinate, offering factually inaccurate but plausible information, or advisors may give misleading, inappropriate, inaccurate or incomplete advice;
- Flexibility e.g. it is costlier, harder, more complicated, and takes longer to plan, execute and test/validate/accredit changes to a secure IT system or process;
- Reliability and trustworthiness e.g. it may be unclear or uncertain whether information is sufficiently correct, complete, current, and controlled following an incident, particularly if the exact nature and sequence of events cannot be ascertained;
- Understanding of information e.g. due to translation or transcription errors, inadequately-explained or ineptly-expressed concepts, cultural and comprehension issues;
- Utility e.g. information that is no longer considered sufficiently trustworthy, complete, accurate, and up-to-date for its intended purposes may be unusable.

Furthermore, incidents may lead to an increase in:

- Information processing, communication, and storage – aside from overheads caused by the operation of security controls, security logs typically store pertinent information for later analysis, and some incidents involve the deliberate or accidental accumulation of ‘junk’ data obscuring events;
- Delays – slowing down dependent decisions, activities, or processes while necessary information is obtained and verified;
- Complexity – increasing controls for a system or process makes it more complicated, adding ‘moving parts’ that all need to function properly and interoperate smoothly; and
- Uncertainties and risks of further incidents – once an incident such as a ransomware attack or privacy breach occurs, that may increase the probability and/or impacts of further incidents.

Ultimately, incidents destroy value. As a consequence of various incidents, information is worth less to its legitimate owners and users, and perhaps more to adversaries or competitors. Furthermore, incidents drive up losses and costs such as:

- The direct loss of asset value e.g. theft and misuse of intellectual property or trade secrets, or reputational damage and brand devaluation;
- Consequential costs due to disruption or prevention of downstream business activities e.g. urgent revision or suspension of commercial plans to launch new products;
- Costs associated with managing, investigating, and resolving incidents e.g. attempting to resume control and regain customer trust, loyalty, and custom;
- The full lifecycle costs of various controls – from specification and design through to their operation, management, and maintenance;
- Opportunity costs – other potentially beneficial investments or activities are delayed, curtailed, or prevented due to the lack of funds and other finite resources, including management and staff attention and energy; and
- External impacts e.g. privacy breaches adversely affect the lives of the individuals whose personal information is compromised.

In the business context, it makes no sense to spend a fortune on reducing trivial incidents. Conversely, targeted investment to avoid, prevent, or contain the damaging effects of significant risks is entirely justified, even necessary. Therefore, we really need to analyse and quantify risk in order to invest appropriately, especially given limited/finite resources.

## Risk Treatment Options

There are four generally accepted ways of treating risks:

1. **Risk Avoidance** - Stopping or not starting particularly risky activities at all. This is seldom appropriate because we normally only do things that have some purpose and value, so if we don’t do them to avoid the associated risk, we lose that value. However, we do sometimes have the option of not taking on significant risks e.g. by consciously and deliberately not releasing sensitive, valuable information to untrustworthy third parties, or pulling out of business arrangements that have become unduly threatening to our interests.

2. **Risk Reduction through Security Controls** - Most risks are ‘mitigated’ in some fashion using technological, procedural, or physical controls (also known as measures, countermeasures, safeguards, etc.). Most controls have a specific purpose (e.g. antivirus controls attempt to spot and block malware infections) while some others are general-purpose (e.g. resilience and backups). Multi-purpose controls (e.g. policies and procedures) can address several risks at once, and as such are often more valuable but less effective than single-purpose controls.

3. **Sharing Risks with Third Parties** - Some risks can be shared by insurers, customers, owners, communities, etc., who undertake to deal with them or accept the consequences (defined liabilities). Website privacy policies are an example: visitors who provide their contact details or other personal information through the website share some of the risk of privacy breaches with the SME on the understanding that specific privacy controls (as laid out in the policies) are in place. Insurance is another example: the insurer undertakes to compensate the insured if specific situations occur, provided the insured has taken ‘reasonable’ (and often specified) steps to reduce the risk. Risks can be shared internally too. SMEs may opt to hold the IT department accountable for all IT risks rather than the individual departments - on the proviso that whoever is accountable has the ability to make key decisions about the risks, and has control over sufficient resources to do so.

4. **Risk Acceptance** - All the remaining risks are said to be accepted, whether deliberately and expressly, or not. We accept risks that were only partially treated by other means (e.g. where the controls are not entirely effective and reliable, or where situations we intended to avoid occur anyway, or where our attempted quantification was inaccurate, perhaps because things changed unexpectedly) plus risks that were untreated (e.g. risks we didn’t even identify as such, due to flaws in that part of the risk analysis process).
